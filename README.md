# Django-Rest-Framework-JWT-Full-Authentication


### Project Description

In this project, I am aiming to implement full authentication using the Django REST framework in the backend. The key features include:

- **Request Sign-Up:** Allowing users to create new accounts.
- **Request Login:** Allowing registered users to log in.
- **Request Reset Password by Mail:** Implementing a password reset mechanism via email.
- **Token Authentication:** Using **SIMPLE_JWT** to handle token-based authentication.
- **Throttling:** Implementing throttling mechanisms to control the rate of requests.
